=============================================
Welcome to MOST's Report Module documentation
=============================================

The MOST project aims to achieve an open, modular and scalable solution for the creation, execution and management of remote clinical consultations with direct interaction between specialists.

The project consists of a set of frameworks that deal with different aspects and technologies useful for the creation of telemedicine applications.

Most Report Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *MOST-Report* Framework allows you to load, edit and export clinical Archetypes (according to the definition provided by the `openEHR Architecture  <http://www.openehr.org/>`_)   
in an Android Application. It lets you build visual forms containing specialized widgets mapped on a specific EHR Datatype you can use for viewing and modifying complex archetypes.

This library internally uses the `SuperToolTips Library  <https://github.com/nhaarman/supertooltips>`_  for rendering the tooltips of the widgets.
