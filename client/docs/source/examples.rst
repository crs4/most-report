All the following examples are located into the folder *client/android/examples/*. 

 * **EhrLibArchetypeViewerExample** This example explains you:
  - how to load a json schema representing a simple Archetype (e.g Blood Pressure)
  - how to populate the fields of the archetype with initial values loaded from a json schema
  - how to edit the fields of the archetype and update the corresponding json structure
  - how to show the current json representation of the archetype
 
For running the Android examples, open your preferred IDE (e.g Eclipse) and do the following changes:
   - Import the Most-Report project library (remember that it requires the `SuperToolTips Library  <https://github.com/nhaarman/supertooltips>`_  as Library  reference) 
   - Open the Android project example from the *android/examples* folder and add the *Most-Report* project both as Library and project reference 
   - Deploy the application on an android device or emulator
