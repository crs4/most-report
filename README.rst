Most Report
===========

The *MOST-Report* Framework allows you to load, edit and export clinical Archetypes (according to the definition provided by the `openEHR Architecture  <http://www.openehr.org/>`_)   
in an Android Application. It lets you build visual forms containing specialized widgets mapped on a specific EHR Datatype you can interact with for viewing and modifying complex archetypes.

This library internally uses the `SuperToolTips Library  <https://github.com/nhaarman/supertooltips>`_  for rendering the tooltips of the widgets.
